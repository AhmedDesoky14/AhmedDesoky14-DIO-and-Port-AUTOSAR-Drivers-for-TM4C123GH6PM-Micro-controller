  - Provides interfaces to configure and control the digital I/O pins.
  - Supports input and output functionality for digital pins, as defined in AUTOSAR.
  - Includes functionality for reading and writing digital values to pins.
  
- **Port Driver**:
  - Configures the port control registers for digital input/output.
  - Handles the mapping of microcontroller pins to specific physical ports.
  - Supports various port modes, such as Digital I/O, Analog I/O, etc.

- **Compliance with AUTOSAR 4.0.3 SWS**:
  - The drivers are designed to meet the AUTOSAR 4.0.3 specification for the **DIO** and **Port** modules.
  - Fully compliant with AUTOSAR guidelines for modular design, configuration, and scalability.

- **TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller**:
  - The drivers are specifically designed for the **TM4C123GH6PM** microcontroller from Texas Instruments, a member of the Tiva C series.
  - Provides easy integration with other hardware and software layers in an AUTOSAR system.

## Project Overview

This project provides low-level drivers for the **Digital I/O** (DIO) and **Port** modules of the **TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller**, designed to be used as part of an AUTOSAR-compliant embedded system. These drivers interact directly with the hardware registers of the microcontroller to configure pins as input or output and allow reading or writing of digital values.
